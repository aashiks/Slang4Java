The original project is writtenin C#.

To run, clone the project into a machine with jdk and ant installed. 
Make sure ant and jdk are in your paths.
Open a terminal, cd into "CallSlang" directory.
Type in "ant run". This should work :)

Alternatively, since these are Netbeans(v7.x) projects the following steps should also work.
Start Netbeans.
Open the CallSlang project. 
Open the Slang4java project.
Run the CallSlang project. Check the output window.
