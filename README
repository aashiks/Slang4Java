A source port of http://slangfordotnet.codeplex.com/.

The original project was written in C#. This is a Java port so I can get a general idea of the workings of a compiler.

To run, clone the project into a machine with jdk and ant installed. 
Make sure ant and jdk are in your paths.
Open a terminal, cd into "CallSlang" directory.
Type in "ant". This should create the CallSlang.jar in dist subfolder of CallSlang directory


Alternatively, since these are Netbeans(v7.x) projects the following steps should also work.
Start Netbeans.
Open the CallSlang project. 
Open the Slang4java project.
Compile CallSlang project
This should create the CallSlang.jar in dist subfolder of CallSlang directory 

SLANG scripts are available in "scripts" subfolder of CallSlang directory

these scripts can be executed from terminal by issuing:

java -jar <fullpath_to_Slang4Java/CallSlang>/dist/CallSlang.jar <fullpath_to_scriptfile>


Currently STEP 4 has been ported. Refer to the pdf available in the DOC folder of the archive available from http://slangfordotnet.codeplex.com/
